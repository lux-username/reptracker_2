# end-session

Order matters: docs first, then commit, so the doc updates ride in the same commit as the session's work.

## 0. Pre-flight

- Confirm you're at the project root (`STATUS.md`, `journal/`, `sessions/` exist). If not, stop and say so.
- `gh auth status` — if it fails, continue, but step 3's fallback applies.

## 1. Derive facts — never recall them

Read the **Derived Facts** table in `CLAUDE.md` and run every command in it. Those outputs are the *only* source for versions, counts, test status, and similar in what follows. If a fact you need has no row, add a row (that's a permanent fix), then run it — do not type the fact from memory.

Also derive: `git log --oneline -10`, `git status --short`, today's date (`date +%F`), and `gh issue list --state open`.

## 2. Rewrite STATUS.md — overwrite, never append

Structure, roughly one screen:

1. First line stamp: `> Generated <date> by /end-session at commit <short-sha>.` (sha of HEAD now; the stamp makes staleness self-evident.)
2. Where things stand — short narrative of current state and current thinking.
3. Derived facts from step 1, each traceable to a command output.
4. Active Milestone: name + link. Point at it; don't restate its contents.
5. Blockers / open questions, if any.

If step 3's fallback fires, its warning block goes **above the stamp**.

## 3. File an Issue for everything unresolved

Every problem, TODO, or "should fix later" surfaced this session that isn't already an open Issue gets one now: `gh issue create --title "..." --body "..."` (assign a milestone where it belongs to one). Nothing outstanding may live only in memory or journal prose.

**If `gh` fails:** do not silently continue. Park the items at the top of `STATUS.md` under `## ⚠ UNFILED ISSUES — gh failed <date>` and tell the user out loud. Filing them is the first task of the next session.

## 4. Append the journal entry

`journal/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<n>.md`, where n = 1 + count of existing entries for today.

Contents: what was done; decisions made (one line each — full rationale goes to decisions.md); Issues opened/closed (`#N`); pointer to `sessions/<same-name>.transcript.md`. Narrative is welcome; tracking is not — the journal narrates plans but is never their only home.

## 5. Append decisions — append-only, never rewrite history

For each real "chose X over Y because Z" this session, append a dated entry to `decisions.md`. If there were none, skip — don't manufacture entries.

`decisions.md` is an append-only ledger. **Never edit or delete a past decision, even when this session reverses it.** When a new decision supersedes an old one, append a fresh dated entry that states the reversal and references the entry it supersedes (e.g. "Supersedes the 2026-07-09 decision to …"); leave the original entry untouched so the reasoning trail stays intact. Optionally add a one-line "→ Superseded by <date>" pointer *appended beneath* the old entry, but do not alter its original text.

## 6. Render the transcript — derive, don't reconstruct

Never write the transcript from memory; read the authoritative on-disk session log.

a. **Locate this session's `.jsonl`.** Invent a random nonce (e.g. `es-<date>-<5 random chars>`), then run:
   `grep -l "<nonce>" ~/.claude/projects/<project-dir>/*.jsonl`
   where `<project-dir>` is the cwd with slashes, dots, and underscores all replaced by dashes (verify by listing `~/.claude/projects/` if unsure). The grep command containing the nonce is written to the current session's log *before* it executes, so the single file it matches **is** this session.
   Fallbacks, in order: (1) if it matches nothing, widen to `grep -rl "<nonce>" ~/.claude/projects --include='*.jsonl'`; (2) if still nothing, take the newest-mtime `.jsonl` in the project dir and say the fallback was used.
b. **Render:**
   `python3 .claude/skills/end-session/scripts/render_transcript.py <found>.jsonl sessions/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<n>.transcript.md --user-label <NAME>`
   The output name must match step 4's journal entry.
c. Verify `sessions/` is still gitignored: `git check-ignore sessions/` — if not, fix `.gitignore` before committing.

## 7. Commit and push

One commit: session work + all doc updates. Reference closed issues (`fixes #N`) — the reference only closes the Issue once the commit reaches the default branch on the remote, which is why push is part of this step, not left for later.

Commit subject uses the date-scoped session label (Issue #32): `Close session <YYYY-MM-DD> (<n>): …`, where `<n>` is the same day-scoped index as step 4's journal entry. Never a bare global "session N" — the date is what makes the label unambiguous.

Then push: `git push`. If the current branch has no upstream, set one: `git push -u origin HEAD`.

**If push fails** (no remote, auth failure, non-fast-forward, offline): do not silently continue. The commit still stands locally; tell the user out loud that the push failed, show the error, and state that the session's work and any `fixes #N` closures are **not** on the remote until they push. Do not attempt a force-push.

Finish by showing the user `git log --oneline -1`, whether the push succeeded, and a one-line summary of what was filed, journaled, and rewritten.
